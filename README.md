  ### Description
  This project combines Javascript, MySQL, Handlebars, and Heroku to serve up the burger of your dreams.  Simply enter the burger you'd like to eat and devour at will.  Check out the live site at [Eat Da Burger](https://shielded-falls-19006.herokuapp.com/).
  
  ### Installation
  No need to install. You can deploy the app live.
  
  ### Usage
  This is an open page for anyone to enjoy.  Type in the name of the burger and click "Add Burger."  If you'd like to eat the burger, click the button that says "Devour It."  The burger will be moved to the Devoured list.  Click "Still Hungry" to move the burger back to the Ready to Eat list, or click Delete if you're done with the burger. ![Screenshot](./public/assets/img/burgerscreenshot.png)
